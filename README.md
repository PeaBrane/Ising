# Ising-Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of standard algorithms for generating and simulating/solving Ising spin glass instances. The examples serve as a rough guideline on using the codes. 

The generation algorithms include the frustrated loop instances and the 3D tiling cube instances. The simulation algorithms include single spin-flip updates, cluster updates (wolff and kbd), and replica exchange methods.

Other than the generation of RBM instances, I take no credit for the invention of these algorithms.

Recent developments in using memory dynamics to simulate glasses are also included.
